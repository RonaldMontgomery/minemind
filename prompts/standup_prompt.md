# Daily Standup Micro-Prompt for minemind (60–90 Minute Work Block)

I’m working on my `minemind` Minesweeper project.  
I want you to act like a **technical lead** helping me plan and execute a focused **60–90 minute development session**.

## Instructions for the AI
Please:

### 1. Restate My Goal
Put it in your own words.

### 2. Break It Into 3–6 Small Tasks
Each task:
- A short name  
- A clear “done means…” description  

### 3. List Edge Cases
Especially ones an AI grader or professor is likely to test.

### 4. Suggest a Small Test Checklist
Informal examples or Python test sketches are fine.

### 5. Provide One Small Code Pattern
One **tiny** snippet or pattern I can adapt (not copy) for one of the tasks.

Then **stop** and wait for me to implement.
